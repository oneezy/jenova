From the day it was drawn
They knew it was a disaster!
Hurricane winds can sweep away
theres noo way to stay away from those of outside waves! (yeah)
Tremendous the destruction is Endless!
Obstructing the views that you choose
now thats diminished!
Life as Endless!
With no dependence 
ya still stuck out from the outside!

How ya gonna hold me back?
When theres a suicidal rage that can attack!

Never gonna hold me back!
Suicidal rage to Attack!


You walking a thin line!
Its a furious fate!
and enough to hasten up the prime time!
aint nuthing else straight!
you can get it in your face!
